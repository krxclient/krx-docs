# Installation

Follow these steps to easily install **KRX Client**:

## Recommended System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (Linux works with Wine but isn't officially supported).
- **CPU**: Minimum 4 cores (x64 architecture preferred over x86).
- **RAM**: At least 8 GB for smooth performance.

## Installation Steps
1.  Download the `.zip` file from [krxclient.xyz](https://krxclient.xyz).
2.  **Create a new folder** (e.g., on your Desktop). **Ensure you extract KRX Client to its own new folder, not inside your existing official DDNet directory.**
3.  Extract the contents of the `.zip` file into this new folder.
4.  Run `KRX Client.exe` from inside the extracted folder.
    *   **Tip:** If the client fails to launch the first time, try right-clicking `KRX Client.exe` and selecting 'Run as administrator'.
5.  For **Premium/Ultimate**, log in with your KRX **username** (not email) and password.

## Troubleshooting
- **Executable Missing**: If the `KRX Client` executable isn't visible, your antivirus software may have removed it. Disable real-time protection temporarily and add an exclusion for the download/extraction folder, then extract the folder again.
