# TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) ![Ultimate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ultimate-%23f76d6d?style=flat-square)

The **TAS** tab in the KRX Client Ultimate version is a feature designed for advanced tool-assisted gameplay, enabling precise and repeatable inputs.  
**Note: Always use the `/showall` command upon joining a server(otherwise weapons, pickups, etc. might not work)**.  
To automatically run this command there's 2 options:
1. `F1->cl_run_on_join showall 1`
2. `Main Menu -> DDNet -> Miscellaneous -> Run on join -> showall 1`

## **FAQ**
1. **Q: Why don’t I see weapons/shields/hearts/etc. in TAS?**  
   **A:** You didn’t run the command `/showall`.  

2. **Q: Why can’t I continue my run after a map change?**  
   **A:** Unfortunately, continuing is not supported across map changes. Stop recording, save your replay, join the map on a different server, and continue from there.  

3. **Q: Why did my TAS fail mid-run?**  
   **A:** TAS failures usually occur due to lag. Use the appropriate `cl_prediction_margin` setting and restart the replay from the correct starting position. Contact support if the issue persists.  

4. **Q: Why can’t I move in TAS?**  
   **A:** Most likely, TAS is paused or `krx_tasrespawn` is set to 1. Unpause TAS or run `krx_tasrespawn 0` in the console to fix this.
