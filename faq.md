## General Questions

### **Where can I download the KRX Client?**
Download the KRX Client from [krxclient.xyz](https://krxclient.xyz). Extract the files to a single folder, preferably a new one on your desktop.

### **Is KRX Client safe to use?**
Yes, the client is safe. However, due to file obfuscation for security, your antivirus might flag it as malicious. This is a false positive.

### **Is KRX Client open source?**
No, it’s a closed-source project. This helps keep it undetected and prevents the creation of effective antibot mechanisms.

## Installation and Setup

### **Why is KRX Client.exe missing from the folder?**
Your antivirus software might have removed it. Disable your antivirus and extract the folder again.

### **How do I install the client?**
For detailed installation instructions, refer to our [Installation Guide](getting-started/installation.md).

## Usage

### **Why don’t I see weapons in TAS?**
You didn’t run the command `/showall`. Run it in the game console.

## Troubleshooting

### **Why do I fail with a blatant config?**
Ensure your config matches the recommended settings. If issues persist:
1. Use the command `cl_prediction_margin 20`.
2. Increase the value gradually up to 300 based on your ping.

### **How can I avoid bans?**
Avoid using blatant configs. Use legit configs shared by members in Discord. Adjust them for your playstyle.
